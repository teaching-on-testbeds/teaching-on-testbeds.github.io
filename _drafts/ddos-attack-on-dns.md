This experiment is a reproduction of the major claims presented in 

> Yehuda Afek, Anat Bremler-Barr, and Shani Stajnrod. 2023. NRDelegationAttack: Complexity DDoS attack on DNS Recursive Resolvers. In 32nd USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 23), USENIX Association, Anaheim, CA, 3187â€“3204. https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/afek

and will measure the cost of the NRDelegation distributed-denial-of-service attack on the resolver CPU load and its effect on benign clients.
