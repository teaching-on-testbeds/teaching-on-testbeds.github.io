In this experiment, you will explore the 5G RAN by bringing up an end-to-end 5G network on a single server. You will see:

* how a 5G RAN can be split with the CU (centralized unit) handling SDAP, PDCP, and RRC layers, and the DU (distributed unit) handling RLC, MAC, PHY layers
* how a CU and DU communicate over the F1 interface

Note that to run this experiment, you will need to have reserved access to compute resources in advance. Refer to the "reserve a server" instructions in order to complete this step several days before you plan to run the experiment.

We will run this experiment on the POWDER testbed.
