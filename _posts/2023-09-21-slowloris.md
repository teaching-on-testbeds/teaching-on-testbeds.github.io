title: Layer 7 DoS attack with slowloris 
author: Fraida Fund
tags: [cloudlab, networking, security]

This experiment explores slowloris, a denial of service attack that requires very little bandwidth and causes vulnerable web servers to stop accepting connections to other users. 

This experiment highlights the difficulty associated with mitigating a denial of service attack, without affecting legitimate users.

It should take about 60 minutes to run this experiment.

You can run this experiment on CloudLab!
