When neighboring 802.11 networks operate on the same channel, they compete with one another to use the shared medium. In this experiment, you will observe the effect on throughput when neighboring cells operate on the same channel vs. on non-interfering channels.

It should take about 2 hours to run this experiment, but you will need to have reserved that time in advance. This experiment uses wireless resources, and you can only use wireless resources on ORBIT/COSMOS during a reservation.
