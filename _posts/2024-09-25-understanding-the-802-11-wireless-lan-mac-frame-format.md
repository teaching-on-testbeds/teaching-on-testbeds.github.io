In this experiment, we will capture traffic on an 802.11 network and observe the 802.11 MAC frame fields using Wireshark. 

It should take about 60-120 minutes to run this experiment, but you will need to have reserved that time in advance. This experiment uses wireless resources, and you can only use wireless resources on ORBIT/COSMOS during a reservation.
