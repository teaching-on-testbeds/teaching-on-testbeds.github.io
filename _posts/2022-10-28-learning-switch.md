In this experimental demonstration of the basic operation of a layer 2 switch/bridge, we will see:

* how to set up a layer 2 bridge on Linux,
* how a bridge or switch learns MAC addresses and updates its forwarding table, and how it forwards, filters, or floods a frame depending on the forwarding table,
* how a bridge or switch reduces collisions by separating each port into a separate collision domain.
* It should take about 60-120 minutes to run this experiment.

You can run this experiment on CloudLab or on FABRIC.
