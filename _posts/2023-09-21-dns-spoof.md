This is an experimental demonstration of two ways a malicious attacker might redirect traffic for a website to its own "fake" version of the site. Both methods involve DNS spoofing. 

* In one version, the attacker will masquerade as the legitimate DHCP server for the LAN and instruct clients to use the attacker for name resolution. 
* In the other the attacker will use ARP spoofing to impersonate the legitimate DNS server and answer name resolution queries in its place.

It should take about 120 minutes to run this experiment.

You can run this experiment on CloudLab!
