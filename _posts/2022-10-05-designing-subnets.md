Your task in this experiment is to set up subnets in a few small LANs to meet given design requirements.

It should take about 60-120 minutes to run this experiment, after you work out what part of the address space to assign to each LAN.

You can run this experiment on FABRIC, CloudLab, or Chameleon.
