This experiment focuses on security services offered at the network layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. 

You will configure a network with a VPN tunnel, and then you will examine the extent to which you are protected from unauthorized eavesdroppers on network traffic, when you use a file transfer application (with and without application layer confidentiality).

It should take about 60-120 minutes to run this experiment.

You can run this experiment on CloudLab, FABRIC, or Chameleon!
