AERPAW is a wireless research platform for experiments involving advanced wireless technologies (such as 5G) and autonomous drones.

AERPAW experiments begin in Development Mode, in the AERPAW Virtual Environment, before they are deployed on the physical testbed in live flight. In this tutorial, you will configure the software you’ll need on your own device, create an account on AERPAW, and run an example experiment in the AERPAW Virtual Environment.

> **Note**
> This process has a “human in the loop” approval stage - students will need to wait for AERPAW staff to approve their account, then again for an instructor or research advisor to approve their request to join their project. They should be prepared to start the tutorial, wait for these approvals, and then continue.
