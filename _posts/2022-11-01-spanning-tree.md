In this experiment, we will see how broadcast storms can occur in a network with bridge loops (multiple Layer 2 paths between endpoints). Then, we will see how the spanning tree protocol creates a loop-free logical topology in a network with physical loops, so that a broadcast storm cannot occur. We will also see how the spanning tree protocol reacts when the topology changes.

It should take about 1 hour to run this experiment.

You can run this experiment on GENI or on CloudLab.
