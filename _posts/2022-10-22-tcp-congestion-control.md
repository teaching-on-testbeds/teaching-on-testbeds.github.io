This experiment shows the basic behavior of TCP congestion control. You'll see the classic "sawtooth" pattern in a TCP flow's congestion window, and you'll see how a TCP flow responds to congestion indicators.

It should take about 1 hour to run this experiment.


You can run this experiment on GENI, CloudLab, FABRIC, or Chameleon.
