In this experiment, we will examine how ARP is used in IPv4 networks -

* to resolve IPv4 addresses of neighbors into link layer MAC addresses
* and to keep track of the neighbor reachability.

It should take about 60 minutes to run this experiment.

You can run this experiment on CloudLab. (It is not currently compatible with FABRIC or Chameleon, due to limitations in how Layer 2 networks are realized there.)
