In this experiment, we examine how ARP is used in IPv4 networks -

* to resolve IPv4 addresses of neighbors into link layer MAC addresses
* and to keep track of the neighbor reachability.

It should take about 60 minutes to run this experiment.

You can run this experiment on CloudLab, FABRIC, or Chameleon!
