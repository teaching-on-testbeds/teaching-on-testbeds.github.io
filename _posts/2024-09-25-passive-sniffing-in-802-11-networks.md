In this experiment, we will observe the level of confidentiality provided by three kinds of WiFi networks - an open WiFi network, a WEP network, and a WPA network.

It should take about 120 minutes to run this experiment, but you will need to have reserved that time in advance. This experiment uses wireless resources, and you can only use wireless resources on ORBIT/COSMOS during a reservation.

You can run this experiment on ORBIT/COSMOS.
