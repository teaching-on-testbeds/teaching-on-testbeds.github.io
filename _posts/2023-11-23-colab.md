title: Connecting Google Colab to your own server

This experiment is for connecting Google Colab to a server running on NSF-supported cloud computing infrastructure.

This allows you to run experiments requiring bare metal access, storage, memory, GPU and compute that exceeds the abilities of Colab's hosted runtime, but with Colab's familiar interface (and notebooks stored in your Google Drive). It also allows you to easily go back and forth between the convenience of Colab's hosted runtime and Chameleon or CloudLab's greater capabilities, as you develop your experiment.

You can run this experiment on Chameleon or on CloudLab.
