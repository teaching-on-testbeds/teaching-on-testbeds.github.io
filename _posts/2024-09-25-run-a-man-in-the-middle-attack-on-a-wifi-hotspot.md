This experiment shows how an attacker can use a simple man-in-the-middle attack to capture and view traffic that is transmitted through a WiFi hotspot.

It should take about 120 minutes to run this experiment, but you will need to have reserved that time in advance. This experiment uses wireless resources, and you can only use wireless resources on ORBIT/COSMOS during a reservation.

You can run this experiment on ORBIT/COSMOS.
