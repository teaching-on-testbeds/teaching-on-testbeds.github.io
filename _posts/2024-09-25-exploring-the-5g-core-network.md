In this experiment, you will explore the 5G core network by bringing up an end-to-end 5G network on a single server. You will see:

* how 5G core network functions can be deployed in containers
* the HTTP2/TCP interfaces between network functions
* the NGAP/SCTP interface between the 5G gNodeB and the 5G core network AMF
* how traffic is exchanged between a UE and an external data network using GTP tunnels

Note that to run this experiment, you will need to have reserved access to compute resources in advance. Refer to the "reserve a server" instructions in order to complete this step several days before you plan to run the experiment.

We will run this experiment on the POWDER testbed.
