title: Nyquist formula: relating data rate and bandwidth

This experiment looks at the relationship between data transmission rate, bandwidth, and modulation scheme, as described by the Nyquist formula.

It should take about 60-120 minutes to run this experiment, but you will need to have reserved that time in advance. This experiment uses wireless resources, and you can only use wireless resources on ORBIT/COSMOS during a reservation.
