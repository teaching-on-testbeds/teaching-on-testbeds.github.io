Most Internet-connected homes use a home network gateway to connect a local area network (LAN) in the home, to a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet. In this experiment, we will look at some of the services that are always or often included on these gateways:

* routing between the LAN and WAN,
* DHCP, to provide hosts in the home network with IP addresses,
* DNS, to respond to name resolution queries from hosts in the home network,
* NAT (Network Address Translation), to map one public IPv4 address to internal (private) IP addresses assigned to hosts on the home network.

It should take about 120-180 minutes to run this experiment.

You can run this experiment on CloudLab.
