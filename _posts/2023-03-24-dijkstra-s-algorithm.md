In this experiment, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from one node in a six-node topology, to all other nodes. We will then install routing rules at each node to implement the shortest-path tree produced by Dijkstra's algorithm.

It should take about 120 minutes to run this experiment.

You can run this experiment on FABRIC or CloudLab.
